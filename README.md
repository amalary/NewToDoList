# NewToDoList

This is a simple web application for creating a task list. The user can input a task into a form, and when they submit it, the task is added to the list below. Each task is represented by a div element, which contains a text input field for displaying the task name and two buttons for editing or deleting the task. The JavaScript code listens for events such as form submission and button clicks, and updates the list of tasks accordingly. The code follows a modular structure and is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
